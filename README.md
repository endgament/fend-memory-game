## Instructions

The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. 

Click on any two cards you like and reveal the icons. If it is a match -- well done!! you are one step closer to victory!! If not -- don't worry. You can try again.

When all the cards are matched, your stats will show up --- moves, time and star rating. 

Play with others and try to be the one with the less moves!
